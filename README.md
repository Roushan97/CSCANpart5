# CSCANpart5


Write a C program to solve the following problem:
Suppose that a disk drive has 5,000 cylinders, numbered 0 to 4999. The drive is currently serving a request at cylinder143, and the previous request was at cylinder 125. The queue of pending requests, in FIFO order is
86, 1470, 913, 1774, 948, 1509, 1022, 1750, 130
Starting from the current head position, what is the total distance (in cylinders) that the disk arm moves to satisfy all the pending requests for each of the CSCAN disk-scheduling algorithms?

NOTE To get the desired output as per question execute repositories which have file name -- CSCANpart5 or visit this link-- https://github.com/Roushan97/CSCANpart5


Now coming to excute file-- first open terminal complie code with <gcc cse2.c>
then<./a.out> without <> Enter the value as per the question.
